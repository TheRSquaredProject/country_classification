A former commanding officer of Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) remains missing since he was allegedly picked up on Wednesday night from his home near the capital's Mirpur DOHS area by some men claiming to be detectives.
 Lt Col Hasinur Rahman, who was also in the army (sacked), was allegedly picked up by plainclothes men at around 10:30pm on Wednesday when he was on his way home after meeting his friends, his wife Shamima Akhter said.
 “We searched for him in every possible place including police stations and DB offices but could not find him,” she told The Daily Star yesterday afternoon.
 Shamima filed a general diary with Pallabi Police station seeking his safe return. She, however, alleged that Pallabi police initially refused to register the general diary.
 Quoting locals, Shamima said that her husband cried for help when plainclothes men tried to force him into a microbus at around 10:30pm. As locals approached to help him, the men, wearing jackets with “DB” inscribed on them, told them they were from the Detective Branch (DB) of police.  
 The men later left with Hasinur in the microbus, she said.
 DB officials, however, said they were unaware of the incident. Mufti Mahmud Khan, Rab's Legal and Media Wing director, also claimed they did not pick him up. 
 Hasinur was sacked from the army for alleged connections to militancy. He also worked with the Border Guard Bangladesh.
 His disappearance came three days after photographer Shahidul Alam was taken from his home by law enforcers on Sunday night.
